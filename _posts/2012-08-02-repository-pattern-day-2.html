<p>Today I dove back into setting up my models and datastores with DataMapper and Postgres and although the going was slow I had some moderate success.  The slow-going is due to the fact that I&rsquo;m using some entirely new concepts and tools, but the pace is gradually picking up as I get more comfortable.</p>

<p>The first new thing (for me) that I&rsquo;m implemented was RSpec&rsquo;s shared_examples. Since I have a working, tested app using in-memory repository, in theory I should be able to just use those tests to insure that my DataMapper objects and Postgres repository behave the same way.</p>

<p>In practice it&rsquo;s not too far off, but there are still a lot of little &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m having to sort out in order to use the same tests and get the same behavior. One of the big ones was namespacing. I have two user classes to represent the different models, one for DataMapper and one for an in-memory User, which means two user.rb files too. In order to make sure that the specs are calling the right one I&rsquo;ve namespaced the in-memory one into a module named &ldquo;Memory&rdquo;. Then my Datamapper User model exists at the top-level. This means that whenever I call <code>User.somemethod</code> I will get my DataMapper model (and I can even put <code>::User.somemethod</code> to be completely sure I&rsquo;m at the top level), and if I want to use my in-memory User I have to call <code>Memory::User.some_method</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s abridged versions of what the two user files look like:</p>

<pre><code>#in file lib/datamapper_datastore/models/user.rb

require 'data_mapper'
class User
  include DataMapper::Resource

  property :id,         Serial
  property :name,       String
  property :email,      String
end
</code></pre>

<p>..</p>

<pre><code>#in file lib/memory_datastore/models/user.rb

module Memory
  class User
    attr_accessor :id, :name, :email
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m implementing the shared examples in my RSpec tests.</p>

<pre><code>#in file spec/datamapper_datastore/models/user.rb

require 'spec_helper'
require 'lib/dm_datastore/models/user'
require 'lib/shared_examples/models/user_examples'

describe "DataMapper user" do
  before(:all) do
    @user = User.new(:name =&gt; "Mike", :email =&gt; "test@test.com")
  end

  it_behaves_like "user model"
end 
</code></pre>

<p>..</p>

<pre><code>#in file spec/memory_datastore/models/user.rb

require 'spec_helper'
require 'lib/memory_datastore/models/user'
require 'lib/shared_examples/models/user_examples'

module Memory
  describe "In-Memory User" do
    before(:all) do
      @user = User.new(:name =&gt; "Mike", :email =&gt; "test@test.com")
    end

    it_behaves_like "user model"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then my shared examples file for the models just loooks like this.</p>

<pre><code>#in file spec/shared_examples/models/user_examples.rb

shared_examples "user model" do
  it "should do something" do
    ...some code...
  end

  context "User password and authentication" do
    it "should set a password" do
      ...some code...
    end

    ...some more tests....
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now whenever I run my specs all of the tests from
shared_examples/user_examples are run for both the DataMappper and
in-memory user objects.</p>

<p>The next step (once I get all of this set-up) will be to set up a
separate rake task to run the specs against the DataMapper objects so
that they aren&rsquo;t called every time I run <code>rspec spec</code>. As I mentioned
yesterday, I was running 100 tests in a .1 seconds so it was easy to constantly
fire them off. After adding in only seven DataMapper tests I&rsquo;ve
added almost a second to the test suite, and it&rsquo;s funny how jarring that
increase in time is. What was an instant flow of green (with some red
and yellow, of course) is now a stuttering line. As I continue with the
shared_examples I&rsquo;ll be adding another 70 tests to various DataMapper
objects, which means approximately 10 seconds of tests. 11 seconds of
tests won&rsquo;t be terrible, but quarantining those tests off into a
separate task will be a lot nicer.</p>

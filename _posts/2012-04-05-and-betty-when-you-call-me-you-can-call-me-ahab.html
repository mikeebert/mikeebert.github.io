<p>While I may in fact be in the Minimax forest it turns out that the search tree I was barking up might not actually bear the fruit I&rsquo;m looking for- or rather I didn&rsquo;t traverse its branches right. So far I haven&rsquo;t been able to find a consistent pattern in the data I&rsquo;ve been gathering that will always lead to the best move.</p>

<p>However, at this point the algorithm is most certainly my white whale. There are a few other tasks for me to tackle this week and I&rsquo;ve already hit my pessimistic estimate on how long the Minimax algorithm would take me&hellip; but seeing as how a) I&rsquo;m learning a TON while I try and solve it and b) this isn&rsquo;t a client project and c) I&rsquo;m still a &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; apprentice- I&rsquo;ve allowed myself to become totally obsessed with figuring it out. Everytime I start to switch gears I think of another way I can try the algorithm and set off hunting a solution. Since it&rsquo;s already Thursday though I realize I may need to delay my hunt until the weekend.</p>

<p>One upside to this endless hunt is that other things seem relatively easier. Last night I attended an intro to JavaScript class that <a href="http://www.twitter.com/benjreinhart">Ben Reinhart</a> is doing for Code Academy alumni and despite the fact that it was a 500mph overview JS suddenly made a LOT more sense to me, so I got that going for me.</p>

<p>There is one task I&rsquo;ve been putting off all week that I really should start. In honor of all things <a href="http://www.wat.tv/video/the-big-lebowski-bob-dylan-fkxk_2gbjz_.html">Lebowski</a> I&rsquo;m going to take on the Bowling kata. If I ever perform this one publicly I would hopefully have two screens so that I could play the opening of the movie in the background.</p>

<p>I was going to write about Day 2 at <a href="http://www.codeacademy.org">Code Academy</a>, a day that made my head spin in great ways and made me embrace how much of a beginner I am &hellip; but that&rsquo;s all been overshadowed by the news that Steve Jobs died today.</p>

<p>Steve&rsquo;s vision <em>and</em> execution inspired me to take the path I&rsquo;m on now and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that holds true for a lot of the current generation of innovators and entrepreneurs as well.</p>

<p>We were asked to submit a quote we liked for our profile page in the Code Academy handbook and several of us picked quotes from Steve. I found the one I chose earlier this year and it instantly became my favorite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for everything, Steve.</p>

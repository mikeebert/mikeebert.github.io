<p>Not a lot to report on for Tuesday, just a busy day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still chipping away at the Minimax algorithm and made some incremental progress. I also took my second run at the Prime Factors kata too and managed to TDD my way to a solution. It&rsquo;s definitely not optomized though as insanely large numbers take quite a bit of time.</p>

<p>Paul, Dan and I are presenting at tonight&rsquo;s <a href="http://gathers.us/events/passion-and-persistence-code-academy-demo-day">Code Academy Demo Day</a> and had our rehearsal last night, so I spent some time prepping our slides and thinking about my portion of the presentation. We&rsquo;re doing a 200mph drive-by of the project and offering some advice to the outgoing class. It really comes down to two words&hellip; which I&rsquo;ll write about tomorrow.</p>

<p>Then after rehearsal I hustled back to 8th Light to catch Aaron Bedra&rsquo;s talk on <a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.generative">test.generative</a> and discussion of alternative approaches to testing. It definitely got the wheels turning. I&rsquo;ll write more once I&rsquo;ve had a chance to do some research.</p>

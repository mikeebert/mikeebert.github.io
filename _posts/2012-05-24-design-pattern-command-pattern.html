<p>Whereas some of the patterns I&rsquo;ve covered so far have felt more like broad strategy, the Command Pattern has a very narrow and specific focus. It is used to create an object that has one specific task and simply waits until it is executed. It&rsquo;s built upon a principle that we&rsquo;ve seen in other patterns too: to separate out the things that change from the things that stay the same.</p>

<p>Olsen&rsquo;s example in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452"><em>Design Patterns</em></a> that quickly made sense for me was a GUI framework that had various buttons defined and styled. If you wanted to use these buttons in your application you wouldn&rsquo;t want to duplicate all that button setup code every time you needed a button and then just change the method for:</p>

<pre><code>def on_button_push
  # some action for this time
end 
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, what you could do is create a separate class that held the action, and pass that new class to your button class upon creation. For example, your new class to send a message would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class SendCommand
  def execute
    send_the_message
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>â€¦and then when you wanted to use the already defined button in your app you could create it like so:</p>

<pre><code>send_btn = ButtonClass.new(SendCommand.new)
</code></pre>

<p>The Button Class would just need to initialize a command attribute for the command you passed it, and then it&rsquo;s method for calling the action would be:</p>

<pre><code>def on_button_push
  @command.execute
end
</code></pre>

<p>(<em>Lots of props to Olsen because my example is almost identical to his but it just  painted the picture so clearly that I didn&rsquo;t want to mess with it.</em>)</p>

<p>The Command Pattern makes so much sense to me after this example that I wondered why I hadn&rsquo;t come across it before now. However, Olsen states that &ldquo;There is something about the Command pattern that seems to invite enthusiastic overuse&rdquo;, and I could certainly see where a newcomer like myself could get carried away.</p>

<p>Olsen includes a whole other section on how you can use the Command Pattern to record steps that a user has taken to track state and then undo and redo commands as well, but I&rsquo;m going to leave that for another post. In the meantime, while I work on my Limelight app this week I&rsquo;m going to dive into the Limelight source code (a GUI framework) and see if I can hunt down some Command Pattern examples in the wild.</p>

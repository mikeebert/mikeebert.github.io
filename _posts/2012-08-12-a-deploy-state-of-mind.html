<p>On Friday morning <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mjansen401">Mike</a> helped me wrap up one last big glitch I was having with PostrgeSQL—a &ldquo;type&rdquo; error that required a manual <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/sql-altertable.html">ALTER</a> of the table. After that it was time to push it up to Heroku and get a few users.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I was imminently faced with deploying that the thought of anyone using this app besides me really sunk in. For a couple of months the project had just been one big exercise in hand-rolling a web application. It was a constant cycle of learn-build-learn-build. Although I knew the plan was for other apprentices to eventually use the app as a tool, I think the thought of anyone actually <em>using</em> my application terrified me just enough that I didn&rsquo;t think about it.</p>

<p>When I did think about users and a deploy this sudden wave of <em>&ldquo;but this isn&rsquo;t readies&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;but what if this happens&rdquo;</em> came crashing down as I poked my head out of the cave I&rsquo;d been in. And along with them came a few lessons:</p>

<p>1) Don&rsquo;t go into a &ldquo;builder&rsquo;s&rdquo; cave. It&rsquo;s important to always have users in mind. This app is supposed to be a learning project for me and one that I work on solo, but it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt to face the fear of actual users a little sooner and more regularly.</p>

<p>2) One of the reasons working with a team is so valuable is because other perspectives are so important. One brain, one way of thinking, one decision maker can lead to a bit of a tunnel— and sometimes going around or over a mountain might be better than burrowing through it.</p>

<p>3) Deploy early and often so that you can find out if all of the &ldquo;buts&rdquo; and  &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo; really matter. Sure I have a long list of things that I think should get done before I have my first user, but having some early testers will help me figure out what&rsquo;s the most important and where I should best focus my energy.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Friday afternoon deploy went pretty smoothly and Mike and I are already using app. There is also already a bug and &ldquo;fix&rdquo; list, but it&rsquo;s relatively short and manageable so I should be able to knock out a lot of it tomorrow.</p>

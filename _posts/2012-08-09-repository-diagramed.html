<p>I figured that I&rsquo;d just draw out how I&rsquo;m using the Repository pattern and shared examples since that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been working on this past week.</p>

<p>As I went down the line setting up each PostgreSQL repository and DataMapper model that correspond to my existing in-memory classes I grew more and more comfortable with what I was doing and how I could user shared examples to both clean up my code and insure that my two data structures were interchangeable. (<a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/28600693251/repository-pattern-day-2">Here&rsquo;s the details</a> on how I set up the shared examples.)</p>

<p>This may have taken longer than I hoped but it was a huge learning experience.</p>

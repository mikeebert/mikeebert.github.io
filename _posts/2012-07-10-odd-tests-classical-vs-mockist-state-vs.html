<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to build out my Sinatra app with more and more features which means that my main app file is continuing to gain more routes and controller actions. In a previous post I discussed a <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/25506907021">sinatra controller-type test</a> and I&rsquo;ve found myself using a similar structure to test the new actions I&rsquo;m adding in. However, these test still feel odd (and maybe not quite right?) to me so I&rsquo;m going to type through them one more time framed by  Martin Fowler&rsquo;s excellent article <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren&rsquo;t Stubs</a>.</p>

<p>In a typical Rails application you have a route like this:</p>

<pre><code>get "accounts/show/:id", :controller =&gt; 'accounts', :action =&gt; 'show'
</code></pre>

<p>and then a controller action that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class AccountsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def show
    @account = Account.find(params[:id)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>To accomplish the same thing in Sinatra you can put your route and your action in the app file:</p>

<pre><code>class Bank &lt; Sinatra::Application

get "/accounts/show/:id" do
    @account = Account.find(params[:id])
    erb '/accounts/show'.to_sym
end
</code></pre>

<p>When I test these actions like I did in my pretious post I&rsquo;m using what Fowler refers to as the &lsquo;Mockist&rsquo; style of testing, and I&rsquo;m testing behavior rather than state. The test for this action would something like this:</p>

<pre><code>it "should ask the database for the account and render the show page" do
    account = mock(Account)
    Account.should_receive(:find).and_return(account)
    get "/accounts/show/1"
    last_response.should be_ok
end
</code></pre>

<p>What this test does is tests the behavior of the actions, so that when I call the GET <code>"/accounts/show/:id"</code> action I test that the Accounts class <em>should_receive</em> the <code>find</code> method, and then I&rsquo;m stubbing out what that <code>find</code> method returns so that it returns a mock Account object I created in the first line of the test setup. The final line of the test is just testing that the view rendered properly, which is more of a state-based test.</p>

<p>I guess this test is ok and the failing messages provide some guidance to write the production code, but I think I&rsquo;m definitely more comfortable with the 'Classical&rsquo; approach, which uses objects to confirm the expected state after an action is executed. Testing state feels much more finite and is how I choose to test almost everything outside of these controller actions. Even if I use mock objects I&rsquo;m still testing that something in the state of my mock objects changed after I used them. Again, it just feels much more concrete than something like the <code>should_receive</code> method.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m honestly not sure of how to Classicly test some of these Sinatra actions so for now I&rsquo;ll stick to the Mockist style. RSpec offers some helpers for testing the variables established in Rails controllers, but no such luck in Sinatra.

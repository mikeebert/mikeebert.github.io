<p>It&rsquo;s Week Two at Code Academy and we&rsquo;re moving along at warp speed. Before this class started I cleared my plate and I&rsquo;m really glad I did. In my previous post I talked about the concept of the &ldquo;empty cup&rdquo; and for me it was important that I not only emptied my cup but gave it a thorough scrubbing (I phased out of my jobs, adopted a ruthless inbox-zero policy and purged the to-do list) and it&rsquo;s a good thing because my brain needs all drive space, RAM and processing power I can give it. I need all the time and practice I can get, and while I&rsquo;m not necessarily seeing how all of the pieces fit together, I can see the overall picture and I&rsquo;m practicing the parts of the puzzle I know. </p>

<p>My reading list is up to seven books now but I&rsquo;m still spending most of my time with *[Apprenticeship Patterns](<a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/index.html">http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/index.html</a>)* and *Learn to Program*. In the beginning of *Apprenticeship Patterns* there is a Software Craftsmanship Manifesto and they include a map of Software Craftsmanship. The [manifesto itself](<a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/sc_manifesto.html">http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/sc_manifesto.html</a>) is powerful, but it&rsquo;s the map that has stuck with me. It includes patterns and practices that they cover in the book such as:</p>

<p>&gt;- The White Belt<br/>
&gt;- Find Mentors<br/>
&gt;- Make Breakable Toys<br/>
&gt;- Read Constantly <br/>
&gt;- Expose Your Ignorance<br/>
&gt;- Retreat Into Competence  <br/>
&gt;- and Practice, Practice, Practice.</p>

<p>In my mind I&rsquo;m consistently referring to how I&rsquo;m experiencing or can apply the patterns in the map. I&rsquo;m most definitely a &ldquo;white belt&rdquo; so &ldquo;exposing my ignorance&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t been a problem. In class and in our reading we&rsquo;re learning enough to allow us to put together tiny programs so during lab time we often make a breakable toy if we have time. Programs that good-naturedly tease each other or trash talk a sports team are usually pretty fun. And when concepts are just too big to wrap my brain around or I need to take break from learning something I&rsquo;ll  retreat into competence and practice, practice, practice. At this point every line of code I write, no matter how simple, helps. I think of the &ldquo;10,000 hour&rdquo; principle or how many practice free throws Michael Jordan shot. Goals are good and the practice is fun. I probably only have 9,950 hours to go.</p>

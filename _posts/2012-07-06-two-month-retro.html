<p>The end of this week marks my second month of residency at 8th Light so I wanted to take a few paragraphs to look back</p>

<h4>Good</h4>

<p>I feel like my learning trajectory has entered another spike with my dive into this Sinatra app and using an in-memory datastore. Sinatra offers barely anything compared to the built in helpers and features that Rails provides, so I&rsquo;m having to learn how to build a lot of things from scratch. I feel like that learning, and the experience of learning and figuring it out, is continuing to fill the &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between a beginner and an intermediate programmer. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also really enjoying life around the 8th Light office. It&rsquo;s a good group of focused, driven and smart people who care about their craft. I can see why former-apprentice-now-craftsman-working-on-site Darek says he misses the place. </p>

<h4>Bad</h4>

<p>The deep dive into learning how the heck to do things in Sinatra and working with an in-memory datastore has deepened my level of comprehension but at the sacrifice of speed. My pace has been a lot slower than I&rsquo;d like it to be. Despite being in the office 8 to 5 every day and then spending a few hours studying each night I have an apprenticeship task list that I&rsquo;d like to be checking things off of much more quickly. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a matter of throwing more time at the problem, it&rsquo;s about comprehending things more quickly. Fortunately I feel like the past couple of week I&rsquo;m picking up momentum in this regard. </p>

<h4>Change</h4>

<p>I think that I can increase the quality of my hours spent working each day by incorporating a solid &ldquo;reset&rdquo; break (or maybe a couple of smaller breaks) and probably some more exercise.  Of course it&rsquo;s Tour time so I probably think about riding my bike twice as much as I usually do, but once the heat subsides I&rsquo;ll have to start looking into taking lunch rides or at least riding the long way home. </p>

<p>I also need to keep working on staying focused and <em>completion</em> as much as comprehension. I&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job the past couple of weeks of not getting pulled into the research rabbit hole of all the things I don&rsquo;t  know, but I think I can do a little better. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I probably should get a little more sleep&hellip;</p>

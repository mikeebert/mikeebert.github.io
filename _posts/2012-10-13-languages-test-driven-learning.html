<p>These past couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve started learning Java in order to build an HTTP server and another tic tac toe game. It&rsquo;s the fifth language I&rsquo;ve worked with in the past two weeks- after Clojure, JavaScript, Ruby and SQL- and I use the word &ldquo;worked&rdquo; very loosely since my JavaScript isn&rsquo;t that great (but getting better) and my understanding of SQL is minimal. Fortunately I was paired up with <a href="http://jneander.github.com/">Jeremy</a> on the JavaScript and <a href="http://ekosz.github.com/">Eric</a> on the SQL to help me along.</p>

<p>Although the context switching between different languages and frameworks has been a little rough, I&rsquo;m getting better at it, and what&rsquo;s surprising (but probably shouldn&rsquo;t be) is how the barrier to learning each subsequent language gets a little lower. I&rsquo;m starting to recognize pattens in new languages that I&rsquo;ve already seen in others, and that goes a long way towards feeling comfortable and having an clue of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>I feel like another big advantage for me when learning a language is that I learned the idea test driven development so early on in my exposure to writing software. When I started with both Clojure and Java I almost immediately started working with a nice, lightweight test suiteâ€” not because of any sort of discipline or principle that I <em>had</em> to test first, but  because tests create this great sandbox where I can play around and get immediate feedback. Of course a REPL or console is a great place for basic experimentation, but a testing framework makes it easier to play around with more complex problems.</p>

<p>In Clojure I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/slagyr/speclj">Speclj</a>, <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> and the <code>lein spec -a</code> command for that immediate feedback loop, and in Java I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/">JUnit</a> and the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> IDE. Getting JUnit up and running seemed way more complex than it should have been because I could never get their example tests to run (I still haven&rsquo;t), but once I decided to skip the samples and just start using JUnit inside of IntelliJ everything was fine. I just download the latest version of JUnit (I could have saved it anywhere I wanted, I chose /Library/Java/Home/lib), and then updated my &ldquo;Library Settings&rdquo; inside of IntelliJ to point to the JUnit directory (You can get to the Library Settings in IntelliJ by hitting &lsquo;F4&rsquo;).</p>

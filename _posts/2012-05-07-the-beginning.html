<p>Today marked another beginning for me, one of many in the past seven months. Late last week 8th Light offered me a resident apprenticeship and after thinking it over and asking myself some tough questions I happily accepted. Today was my first official day as a resident.</p>

<p>So what exactly is a residency and what was there to think about? For me the biggest question was, &ldquo;am I ready?&rdquo;. My impression of the 8th Light apprenticeship is that it&rsquo;s a mix of a traditional craft apprenticeship with a graduate program that you receive a scholarship for (since resident apprentices are compensated). The standards and expectations are extremely high and just because you may &ldquo;make it through&rdquo; your apprenticeship there is still no employment guarantee at the end. I remember the first time Mike showed me the list of requirements in order to be an 8th Light craftsman I asked him, &ldquo;How much of this did you learn during your apprenticeship?&rdquo; and he answered, &ldquo;Pretty much all of it&quot;â€” and I&rsquo;m sure I asked him again just to clarify that I heard him right.</p>

<p>So when I was offered the residency that was my question, was I ready: to learn &quot;all of it&rdquo; and to push myself even further than I have these past seven months. After thinking about it the answer was definitely yes, and because the challenge is a little scary it&rsquo;s all the more reason to take it on. That&rsquo;s a lesson I learned from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/camthor">this guy</a> in a previous job and what now feels like <a href="http://ebertchecksin.blogspot.com/2008/07/paparazzi-are-dumb.html">a previous life</a>.</p>

<p>Myles, one of 8th Light&rsquo;s craftsman, had a recent post about <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/myles-megyesi/2012/04/30/why-i-chose-to-be-an-apprentice.html">his own decision to become a craftsman</a> and many of his considerations mirrored my own. Micah also recently had a good post about <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2012/04/25/apprenticeship-over-college.html">&ldquo;Apprenticeship Over College&rdquo;</a>. 8th Light&rsquo;s apprenticeship program follows a tradition of challenging work/learning experiences and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of it.</p>

<p>While working through the minimax algorithm the past few weeks a few other things started to click for me, and one was my ability to read through other programming languages better. I definitely noticed it in the CA alumni Wednesday Night JavaScript class and while I was investigating various Minimax solutions I came across some C#, Python and C++ examples that were pretty easy to decipher. I&rsquo;m sure several people have said this, so I&rsquo;m not sure who to accredit it to, but once you&rsquo;ve got the basics down other computer languages definitely start to feel more like dialects than entirely new languages.</p>

<p>Java is a language that&rsquo;s used a bit around the 8th Light office and all of the examples in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335873751&amp;sr=8-2">PPP</a> book were also written in Java. When I first started reading the book I felt like the language was a hurdle to fully understanding the examples, but these past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been reading more Java and it&rsquo;s definitely making a lot more sense (so I&rsquo;m going to go back and read some sections of PPP).</p>

<p>On Friday, <a href="http://apprenticepatrick.blogspot.com/">Patrick</a> (who is also became 8th Light&rsquo;s newest craftsman on Friday!) walked me through a problem he was trying to solve in Java and explained the concept of threads and concurrency. He wants to be able to spin off a thread to update a routes file that is then immediately available for use (without having to recompile or interrupt the flow of the other threads in progress). Patrick did a great job explaining it and then this weekend Ben wrote <a href="http://blog.benvoss.me/post/22062694826/a-comprehensive-introduction-to-concurrency-in-java">a solid post</a> about concurrency in Java that helped explain things even more. To top it all off Mike had me fire up <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> yesterday to run minimax and a few other algorithms to see what the performance differences were. The initial move time was cut by about two-thirds! Today I&rsquo;ll be investigating JRuby a little bit more to figure out the magic behind it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s field trip day as I make the trip up to 8th Light&rsquo;s office in Libertyville. I&rsquo;m looking forward to finally seeing the other office and it&rsquo;s always refreshing to sneak out of the city for a few hours.</p>

<p>Class is moving fast and it&rsquo;s pretty extraordinary how much we&rsquo;ve learned in a week and a half. This screenshot, however, was not part of class work. During class breaks I&rsquo;ve been working through the exercises in <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Learn To Program</a> to just practice, practice, practice. This one was fun and required way more logic than coding expertise. Good thing I have experience with the subject matter.</p>

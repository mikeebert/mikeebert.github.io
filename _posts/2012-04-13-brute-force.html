<p>If you look up the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shift">definition of shift</a> you&rsquo;ll find a pretty long list of definitions. I could easily write a few pages on how each of them relate to the title of this here blog, but the past few days I&rsquo;ve been thinking primarily of the mental shift (and mental shifting of gears) from my previous life to now. More specifically: how I used to solve problems and how I&rsquo;m learning, and want to learn, to solve problems now.</p>

<p>I would say that from the age of about 14 on I defaulted to always using brute force to solve a problem- pretty much any problem. And by brute force I mean that if I had a goal, I&rsquo;d choose a strategy, and I&rsquo;d work that strategy until I met my goal. Sometimes I could just tweak the strategy a little bit, and sometimes I&rsquo;d have to start over. If I tried solving a problem enough ways then I&rsquo;d eventually get to the solution. Then I had an answer if I was faced with that same challenge again (or a similar one). If I was faced with that same problem repeatedly I would tweak and adjust the solution to always make it a little better. (This pattern relates quite a bit to <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/20903208781/mark-it-8-dude">my last post</a> too).</p>

<p>Brute force was definitely always my tactic with math and puzzle problems; in my papers in college I&rsquo;d argue that a lot of my writing used brute force too; and in my early-20&rsquo;s when I started managing <a href="http://www.abdcycling.com">the ABD club</a>, a large volunteer organization with 20+ events a year, I used brute force to figure out what the heck I was doing (but fortunately I had a lot of help too).</p>

<p>Sure, brute force always got the job done (and getting the job done is what I was paid for), but there definitely could have been better solutions: ones that were cleaner, more efficient and that left me better prepared for the future. Now that I&rsquo;m faced with more complex problems in code (that can involve many other people working on the same code base and will be handed off to others down the line), I&rsquo;m slowly learning to take a step back before I barrell forward with the first feasible solution that pops in to my head.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are many signposts to help: established design patterns, the SOLID principles, and many smells to warn me if I&rsquo;m headed down the wrong path. I&rsquo;m still not versed in that many of them, and oftentimes I still just end up needing brute force to meet my goal, but I&rsquo;m enjoying the shift as I learn the value of a well-considered solution.</p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, back in the weeds&hellip;</em></p>

<p>This week I started incorporating the <a href="http://ai-depot.com/articles/minimax-explained/">MiniMax algorithm</a> into my tic-tac-toe game AI. The algorithm is designed to look through possible game scenarios, rank the outcomes, and then make a decision on the best move to make. It&rsquo;s like when you play a board game against a friend and try to think of all the possible moves that can be made based on your next move.</p>

<p>Although I feel I have a good grasp on what the algorithm is supposed to do, getting that down into Ruby code is a whole other beast. Yesterday was another one of those days when I&rsquo;m sure there was smoke billowing out my ears. I spent a lot of time in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">IRB</a>, writing pseudo code, and sketching out what I wanted to make the data do. I tried several different approaches and after a few minutes of each I&rsquo;d optimistically feel that I was mere keystrokes away from the solution&hellip; but then many more minutes would pass by before I&rsquo;d finally take a break and decide to try a new tactic.</p>

<p>During Code Academy I wrote about the cycle of going <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/12455091110/in-and-out-of-the-weeds">in and out of the weeds</a> and linked to <a href="http://thisismadebyhand.com/film/the_knife_maker">this wonderful video</a> about knife making. Learning something new is tough, and although I need to keep in mind that it still hasn&rsquo;t even been six months since I wrote my first line of code&ndash; it still stings when &ldquo;you cut yourself, you burn yourself, you f*!$ stuff up, you ruin something you worked on for like three weeks&rdquo; (seriously, go watch the video).</p>

<p>In that post I also referenced the C.A. application question about &ldquo;Why are you applying to Code Academy?&rdquo;, but now there&rsquo;s another question from the application that I finally understand why they asked. <em>&ldquo;Tell us about a time when you almost quit something, but chose not to.&rdquo;</em> My answer to that question boiled down to &ldquo;pretty much my entire cycling career.&rdquo; While I&rsquo;m not saying that the thought of quitting coding has entered my mind, the thoughts when the smoke starts billowing out my ears are the same as when I&rsquo;d go out and train mile after mile. But instead of &ldquo;are my legs ever going to push this bike fast enough?&rdquo;, I ask &ldquo;is my brain ever going to wrap itself around this problem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s when I take a break, maybe stare out the window, maybe ask for some help, maybe even close my eyes and lay down in the 8th Light hammock&hellip;and rest up for another push. Because as long as I keep moving forward, the answer will always be yes.</p>

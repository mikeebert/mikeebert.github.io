<p>Tonight there was a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoSC/">ChiSC meetup</a> and then I had some family stuff to tend to so this is going to be a short post.</p>

<p>This morning I got clearance to set aside tic-tac-toe for now and dive into my next app. It will be used to track an apprenticeship and I&rsquo;m going to wire it up using <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. Since I&rsquo;ve never used Sinatra I&rsquo;ve been reading through some documentation the last couple days and today started learning how to integrate <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>.</p>

<p>Nettuts actually has a <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/ruby-for-newbies-testing-web-apps-with-capybara-and-cucumber/">pretty good tutorial</a> on serving up your first few pages with Sinatra, taking in some parameters, and then integrating Cucumber with Capybara. I was messing around on my own before I started the tutorial and I think one of my files is off because I&rsquo;ve hit a snagâ€”my tests get hung up and I have to manually quit them. However, after I integrated the steps definition file from the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber-sinatra">cucumber-sinatra gem</a> everything worked great. Unfortunately there&rsquo;s just a few too many &lsquo;freebies&rsquo; in this file (like 200 lines worth of freebies) for me to feel comfortable just using it, but at least it got me going. Once I have a little more experience with tying all of this together I&rsquo;ll write a more in depth post.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also spent the last couple of days digging into the source code for one of 8th Light&rsquo;s internal apps and it&rsquo;s been awesome to dive in and explore a web app again- especially one built like this. It really did feel like I dove into some beautiful lagoon where I get to swim around and see all these design patterns up close that I&rsquo;ve only read about in books. There&rsquo;s definitely going to be a few posts coming out of it.</p>

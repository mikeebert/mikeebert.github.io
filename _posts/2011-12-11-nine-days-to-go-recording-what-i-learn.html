<p>I&rsquo;ve been fighting a cold all week so this will be a quick post. </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it on so many levels, but Code Academy Demo Night is just nine nights away. The past two months just flew by and it&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s almost over but harder to believe how far we&rsquo;ve come already. </p>

<p>Since my energy levels have been low this week I&rsquo;ve been doing more consuming than producing: mainly reading (books and code), working on the Ruby Koans (just 60 to go) and going over my class notes– which line up with the <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/perpetual_learning.html#record_what_you_learn">Apprenticeship Pattern, &ldquo;Record What You Learn&rdquo;</a>. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kept all my notes from each day of class, speakers, and readings in a great program called DevonThink. I have about 80 files of notes after the past two months but I can easily search them and the more I work on projects (my own or others) I find myself often going back to my notes. I&rsquo;ve also been publishing them to our Code Academy Dropbox in case anyone else can use them or missed a day of class. Since I wasn&rsquo;t feeling up to starting anything new this weekend I forced myself to go back, read the notes, and then write up weekly digests for the past five weeks. It was really interesting (and a little fun) to connect the dots between things we learned at different times and then augment or correct my earlier notes. Ha! One month-younger me was so naïve&hellip; never knew what was coming.</p>

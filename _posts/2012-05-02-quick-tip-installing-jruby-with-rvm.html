<p>As I mentioned I installed <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> to test the performance differences of my minimax algorithm using JRuby vs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_MRI">MRI</a>. Although JRuby would run I kept getting &ldquo;TypeError: Can&rsquo;t Convert Hash to String&rdquo; errors from various config files during the install.</p>

<p>On the JRuby.org page their instructions for installing with RVM are just:</p>

<pre><code>If you use RVM, then installing JRuby is also a piece of cake:
rvm install jruby  
</code></pre>

<p>Well, yeah, not so much cake for me. Fortunately I came across these instructions over on the <a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki">JRuby wiki</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Note: If you're using RVM to install JRuby, remove these options from (your optional 
 rubygems configuration file) ~/.gemrc: --conservative --local.

With `--local', (at this writing) RVM fails to obtain the jruby-launcher gem required by jruby.

With `--conservative', the older rubygems (at this writing, 1.8.9) currently used by JRuby fails
 to begin gem executables with #!/usr/bin/env, and that doesn't work on most systems.

Then: rvm install jruby ; rvm use jruby
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough, my .gemrc file (located at ~/.gemrc) had those two lines. I removed them for the install, and voil√°, everything ran perfectly.</p>

<p>(After the install I added those two lines back in. You can find out more about what they do and other gem commands at the <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/">RubyGems guides</a>.)</p>

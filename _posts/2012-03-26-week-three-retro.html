<p>I&rsquo;m three weeks into my apprenticeship at 8th Light and last week can be summed up in one word: testing.</p>

<p>I started off the week refactoring some code that I&rsquo;d written tests for, then worked on my first code kata (and even got to demo it at Code Academy), and then in the second half of the week I learned about mocks and stubs and rolled my own to pretty much re-write a huge portion of my test suite.</p>

<p>As a result of all that testing I&rsquo;ve definitely become more comfortable with Rspec and whenever I write code I have that part of my brain that starts thinking in tests first.</p>

<p>This past week I also felt like I started to get a better feel for daily life around 8th Light and I started to find a rhythm. Although I&rsquo;d spent some time around the office during my Code Academy apprenticeship with Mike, the first couple of weeks still felt a bit like <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#ch02_id2375848">jumping in the Deep End</a>. At first I was just treading water to get my bearings and make sure I didn&rsquo;t drown, but by the end of this past week I was a-ok and even comfortable enough to start thinking about where I wanted to swim to next.</p>

<p>I wrapped up the week pairing with <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/dave-moore">Dave Moore</a> and getting my first look at <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slagyr/joodo">Joodo</a> (a framework for Clojure). Despite the fact that so far I&rsquo;ve spent 95% of my time in Ruby, the language actually looked very natural and I was able to read through it pretty quickly. Dave did a great job of starting at the very beginning too and showing me all the steps to get a webapp up and running in Joodo (and my experience with Rails definitely helped with understanding the framework.) I have hunch I&rsquo;m going to spending a lot more time with it.</p>

<p>On to Week Four.</p>

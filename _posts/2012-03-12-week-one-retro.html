<p>Last week I finished reading about the last of the SOLID principles in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445">PPP book</a>, the Interface-Segregation Principle. But since I&rsquo;m not that confident in discussing it yet I&rsquo;m going to use this post as a retro on my first week of studying to be an apprentice at 8th Light.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t beat around the bush- it&rsquo;s been tough. I feel like during Code Academy I learned how to read a blueprint, build a house, furnish it and decorate it. It was built out of wood, had some sweet furnishings and came in whatever color I wanted- and I was pretty happy with some of the things I built. But the past week at 8th Light has definitely been a trip all the way back to <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/day/2011/10/09">being a beginner</a>. I feel like I&rsquo;m learning how to eventually design and build anything from a Richard Meier to a skyscraper, but I&rsquo;m starting by building a brick fort in the back yard and I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about masonry, the various types of bricks or what the heck to do with mortar.</p>

<p>As I knew, the code I wrote last week while &ldquo;spiking&rdquo; through my command-line tic-tac-toe app violated quite a few principles and had plenty of &ldquo;smells&rdquo; emanating from it. This week&rsquo;s big challenge is to blow it apart into clear, clean, SOLID, tested code. While I feel like I understand the bigger concepts of what I need to do, it&rsquo;s the laying of the bricks, the spreading of the mortar and figuring out how the heck to keep the walls aligned that I&rsquo;m struggling with. With Rails I at least knew what to do with a hammer and nail, but those tools won&rsquo;t help me much now.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are a couple of encouraging things to keep me plugging away. The first is the camaraderie amongst the apprentices at 8th Light. A lot of the time it&rsquo;s like a study hall around the office as everyone focuses on their learning, but everyone also tries to help each other out and make themselves available to each other for questions. There&rsquo;s been some excellent diversions too: last week Mark practiced his bowling kata for a few of us, today Cymen worked on explaining LSP for us (a lot of us have the same questions about it), and Ben and I also took a much-needed jigsaw puzzle break this afternoon. The other encouraging thing is that when I think back to the first week of Code Academy and just how &ldquo;in the weeds&rdquo; I felt then. Eventually I got it and I learned how to build some stuff. I know that as long as I keep working away I will this time too.</p>

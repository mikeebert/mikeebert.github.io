<p>I spent the entire day yesterday working on the Minimax algorithm and made a lot of progress. There were a couple of things that contributed:</p>

<p>1) At Mike&rsquo;s suggestion I spent some time at the whiteboard&hellip; and I used a lot of it. I pretty much just wrote out my two main methods and the act of hand-writing them really helped to unravel the knots I&rsquo;d tied up inside my head. It also helped me discover both flaws in the code and places that I could tighten it up.</p>

<p>2) The white board is by the big windows, hammock and treadmill desk, so whenever anyone needs to take a break from their screen they often wander up to this area. Mark, Ben and Cymen, three resident apprentices, wandered up there while I was writing on the board and I was able to chat with them a little about what I was trying to do and where I was getting stuck. It&rsquo;s amazing how differently the brain processes things when it&rsquo;s verbal and talking to these guys definitely helped me see the problem from a different perspective. Mark also suggested that I use a 2x2 grid for debugging purposes as long as my methods for the Board class would still work. Fortunately they did so that&rsquo;s been a huge help.</p>

<p>I think my final hurdle is persistence- and in the code sense, not the tenacious sense. With my recursive method as it is I&rsquo;m not holding the right branches of the game in memory properly so the possible outcomes that the AI is returning are the result of playing out previously half played games.</p>

<p>Hopefull today I can unravel that final knot.</p>

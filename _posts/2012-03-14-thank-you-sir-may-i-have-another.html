<p>Confession: I hated revising. As an English major at a <a href="http://www.coloradocollege.edu">wacky liberal arts school</a> I did a lot of writing. Most classes required at least one 12-20 page paper and I think there&rsquo;s even a bound 60-pager about Chaucer sitting somewhere on the campus library shelf with my name on it.</p>

<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t a great writer- in fact, I&rsquo;ve never wanted to find out if that bound copy actually exists because I&rsquo;ve looked back at some of my college writing and it makes me cringe. My ideas were sound and I even managed to get some decent grades, but I&rsquo;m ashamed that I handed in some of those papers. The content is fine, the punctuation is in the right places&hellip; but it could have been better, waaaay better.</p>

<p>However, all I aimed for was to write a paper that was &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. I was training full time and had a <a href="http://www.krcc.org">work-study job</a> that I loved, so when it came to my studies I aimed for the minimal amount of effort to get the grades I was happy with. I wrote papers that were &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, looked them over for grammatical errors, and handed them in. If my professors criticized my writing sometimes I&rsquo;d even have the guts to say, &ldquo;but it gets my point across!&rdquo; (thank you <a href="http://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/english/people/faculty.dot">Re, George and Dan</a> for putting up with me).</p>

<p>But if I want to be a Software Craftsman, &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; definitely doesn&rsquo;t cut it, and &ldquo;but it works!&rdquo; is not a defense for poorly written software. I remember when I first met up with Mike to go over the Rails tic-tac-toe app that I wrote in order to apply for the apprenticeship. There was a small part of me that was proud I met all the requirements and the game really was unbeatable (&ldquo;but it works!&rdquo;), but a bigger part of me knew that the code was a hot mess. I hadn&rsquo;t written a single test (because I really didn&rsquo;t know how to then), my rules-based computer AI was a massive &ldquo;if/elsif&rdquo; chain, and I basically stuck all the code into either the model or just one controller method. Although I was fully prepared for twenty well-deserved licks from the &ldquo;crappy coder&rdquo; paddle, instead Mike just gave me the feedback I needed and some recommended reading on how to make the code better.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been the same with my command-line tic-tac-toe app as well, but now I&rsquo;m starting to recognize where my thinking is wrong before I even type out the code. Since I still don&rsquo;t have enough experience on what the right code should be I usually end up typing out some hack anyway, but now I at least have an idea of what questions I need to ask in order to make it better.</p>

<p>The idea of being ok with making mistakes and open to receiving feedback are something that both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Imperative-Pete-McBreen/dp/0201733862">Software Craftsmanship</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do">Apprenticeship Patterns</a> discuss. I think being one of the &ldquo;new guys&rdquo; at 8th Light I was a little hesitant to be caught making mistakes and nervous about the feedback I&rsquo;d get, but this initial apprenticeship time is the period when I&rsquo;m allowed to make mistakes and also have access to really great feedback. So, I&rsquo;ll code to the best of my ability, ask questions about what I can do better, and soak up any and all feedback. Thank you sir, may I have another.</p>

<p>Today I worked on some form validations to let my users knew if their input was valid or notâ€” and then provided them with some guidance if there were errors and the input didn&rsquo;t save. Rails and ActiveRecord offer plenty of built-in support for this and DataMapper even has some options too, but they don&rsquo;t quite work they way I need them to.</p>

<p>I figured that HTML5 offered some nice options and a quick Google search led me to <a href="http://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/">this page</a>, which offered many of the little shortcuts you could add to an <code> input </code> tag for validation.</p>

<p>For example, you could do something as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="email" required&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now if your user pushed the &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button without filling in the email field then a little popover would let them know that it&rsquo;s required.</p>

<p>Additionally, HTML5 also offers specific type attributes that can check formatting (with rules that vary by browser). An example of this with the type &ldquo;email&rdquo; would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="email" name="email" required&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>Now the user not only has to definitely put some text in the field but they also need to have a properly formatted email address. The rules of a properly formatted email address vary from browser to browser, but typically it at least requires an &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol.</p>

<p>And for the cherry on top there is the <code>pattern</code> attribute that you can add to the input tag, and it accepts JavaScript regular expressions. The example that the aforementioned site uses is an input tag that requires a url in the proper format:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="url" name="website" required pattern="https?://.+"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This insures that not only does a user have to enter something and that it&rsquo;s a url, but that it is specifically a url preceded by &ldquo;http://&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There is only one huge problem with all of this: it doesn&rsquo;t work on all browsers, and especially not older ones. I actually can&rsquo;t even get it to work in Safari 6 locally, although Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/safari/html5.html">advertises the new Safari</a> as offering HTML5 forms validation.</p>

<p>As nice as HTML5 form validation is &hellip; it looks like I&rsquo;ll have to find another solution.</p>

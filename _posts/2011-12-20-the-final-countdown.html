<p>Another short post this week since I&rsquo;ve been busy cranking on code and preparing for my Code Academy <a href="http://gathers.us/events/passion-and-persistence-code-academy-demo-day">demo night</a> presentation tomorrow.</p>

<p>It hasn&rsquo;t hit me (mainly because I&rsquo;m not allowing myself to think about it too much),  but in less than 24 hours we will all be officially done with this step in our journey. I don&rsquo;t think any of us want it to end,  I certainly don&rsquo;t,  and in order to keep the momentum going I&rsquo;m hosting &ldquo;Holidays with Hartl&rdquo; next week. 10 of my kindred spirits are coming over on Tuesday through Friday to crank through the 500 page Hartl tutorial and just practice, practice, practice.</p>

<p>Now off to bed so I&rsquo;m all bright eyed and bushy tailed for the big event.  I&rsquo;ll probably post some of my presentation notes in the next couple of days too.</p>

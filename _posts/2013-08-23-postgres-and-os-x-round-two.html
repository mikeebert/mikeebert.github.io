<p><em>TL;DR
If you&rsquo;re on OS X, installed Postgres with homebrew, and are receiving errors asking if your Postgres server is running locally and accepting connections, check that your PGHOST is configured for localhost</em></p>

<p>In the never-ending battle that is Postgres versus Mac OS X, which I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/25576735173/setting-up-sinatra-datamapper-postgresql-rspec">written about before</a>, Postgres narrowly claimed a victory tonight but four little words and a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16204429/1883265">helpful Stack Overflow answer</a> saved the day.</p>

<p>I was digging into a Rails app and firing up Postgres for one of the first few times on a computer running OS X 10.8.4. When I tried to run any of the <code>rake db</code> commands I received what unfortunately may be a familiar error for any dev trying to run Postgres on OS X:</p>

<pre><code>could not connect to server: No such file or directory
    Is the server running locally and accepting
    connections on Unix domain socket "/var/pgsql_socket/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</code></pre>

<p>Seeing as how I&rsquo;d stared down the Postgres beast before I was confident this would be a relatively quick yak-shave and tried to fire up Postgres on the command line. Somewhat surprisingly it worked and I was able to create and edit tables and roles without any problem.</p>

<p>Next I did a check for running processes via &lsquo;ps auxwww | grep postgres&rsquo; and I could see that all the expected postgres processes were there. Hmmm&hellip;.</p>

<p>The next line in the stack trace directed me down into the gem file&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>../gems/activerecord-3.2.13/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb:1216:in `initialize'
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;but when I opened that I immediately spied a splat operator in the method that meant the offending argument could really be anything&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>def connect
      @connection = PGconn.connect(*@connection_parameters)
</code></pre>

<p>So then I took a step back and wandered back up to the original error. What stuck out to me there was the very specific socket in the error: <code>.s.PGSQL.5432</code>.</p>

<p>A Google search then led me to my solution, which was to configure my PGHOST to point to <code>localhost</code>. This could be done in one of two places, either by adding 'export PGHOST=localhost&rsquo; to a file that handled some of my other variables (like my ~/.bash_profile), or by adding <code>host:localhost</code> to the Rails app&rsquo;s config/database.yml file (for the test and development environments.</p>

<p>I ended up setting the variable in my .bash_profile because when I fired up an old Sinatra app that used Postgres I received similar errors. Setting the variable system-wide took care of those errors as well.</p>

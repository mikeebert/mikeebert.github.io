<p><em><strong>Kata</strong>:a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata">wiki</a></em></p>

<p>(<a href="https://gist.github.com/2127291"><em>See the code for my Change Kata</em></a>)</p>

<p>Last Friday I started my first kata. It&rsquo;s a coin change kata that challenged me to TDD my way through a program that returned the fewest coins for a given amount. I purposely didn&rsquo;t look at any solutions or think about it much before I started because I really hoped the tests would drive the solution.</p>

<p>I was about five minutes into my first run when I knew that I was headed down the wrong path. The logic wasn&rsquo;t flowing as easily as it should have so rather than fight it I deleted all the code and started again. The next time was silky smooth and a few minutes later the tests had led me straight to the solution. However, the point of TDD and code katas aren&rsquo;t just to figure out a solution but to practice red, green, refactor. So I ran through it a few more times, got the thumbs up from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mjansen401">Mike</a> that my tests were providing the coverage I needed, and then took on one more big refactor of my CoinChanger.</p>

<p>All my tests passed and I was so excited I tweeted about it… which led to a response a few minutes later from <a href="http://codeacademy.org/staff">Jeff Cohen</a> asking if I wanted to come in and lead the class in some TDD and Rspec. In the same instant that I thought about how unqualified I feel to teach this stuff I remembered just how foreign all of it felt when I was sitting where the current Code Academy students are now— so I said, &ldquo;sure!&rdquo; When Jeff spoke at 8th Light University last week about teaching beginners he talked about how important it was to start  <em>at the very beginning</em> and since the very beginning is fresh in mind I definitely know how to start there.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Jeff and the students for having me because I had a lot of fun. I started out by explaining a couple of high level reasons why a person should practice TDD and then led them through the change kata. It was my first public run through and I tried to engage the class by prompting them for the code I should write to make a test pass …and by engage I also mean screw up so that they could help me fix it (thanks <a href="http://www.twitter.com/umtrey">Trey</a>). After the change Kata we set up a Rails app from scratch with Rspec and ran through a few very basic tests. It was all great practice for me and hopefully the students picked up a few things.</p>

<p>The link at the top is an overview of the steps I took to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the kata (which is slightly different from what we ended up doing in class). It&rsquo;s available on <a href="https://gist.github.com/2127291">Github</a>.</p>

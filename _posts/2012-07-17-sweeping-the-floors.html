<p>Yesterday I mentioned a pair of Apprenticeship Patterns so I figured I&rsquo;d stick with the theme and discuss one more I&rsquo;m working on: <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/accurate_self_assessment.html#sweep_the_floor">Sweeping the Floors</a>.</p>

<p>While I continue learning and working on my coding chops I want to be able to help out any way I can, which sometimes involves non-coding tasks. At 8th Light all of the apprentices chip in to help out around the office and especially during <a href="http://university.8thlight.com">8th Light University</a>. Not only do many hands make light work but it&rsquo;s also just a lot of fun and builds up the camaraderie. Plus, nothing says team-building exercise like taking out the trash together only to end up trapped in the freight elevator… and subsequently rescued by fellow 8th Light'ers.</p>

<p>The past couple of days I&rsquo;ve taken on internet duty since at 8th Light &ldquo;we crush the internets&quot;™ (new company motto?). Well, not really, but we have had to add some bandwidth as more teams and clients are coming through the office. I&rsquo;m a hardware geek from way back when and it&rsquo;s been a heck of a puzzle to figure out the best way to keep everything humming.</p>

<p>Today we made one big jump that went well, tomorrow we&rsquo;ll make another jump, and then Thursday will be the dry run before Friday&rsquo;s big test with <a href="http://8th-light.gathers.us/events/8lu-unit-component-integration-and-system-testing">Uncle Bob speaking at 8th Light University</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making some good progress on my apprenticeship app, but &quot;sweeping the floors&rdquo; provides a few distractions that gives my brain a bit of a break and helps split up the day.</p>

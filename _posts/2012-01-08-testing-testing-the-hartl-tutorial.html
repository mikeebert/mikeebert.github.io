<p>This week <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thomascullen">Tom</a> and I finished up Michael Hartl&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a>. About a week before Code Academy had started Neal (one of CA&rsquo;s co-founders) strongly recommended that we try and tackle this 500+ page book and during the 12 weeks of class he consistently asked us if we finished it. Well, although most of us took a stab at it during class, we were often too busy learning and working on other projects and only a couple of people actually finished it (Alfonso and Alex jump to mind). Hence, we formed the &ldquo;Holidays with Hartl&rdquo; study group to finally tackle the beast so Neal would stop asking if we finished it (and maybe to help ward off the Code Academy withdrawls). So, here&rsquo;s my two pennies worth&hellip;</p>

<p>The Hartl tutorial is like a round-the-world trip in a supersonic jet. It will take you on a loooong journey at a very fast pace and at the end you might step out of your plane only to realize you&rsquo;re on the same runway you started at. For someone who is new to programming or Rails, it might be just a little too much information a little too fast, but there will definitely be some knowledge gained on your journey and it&rsquo;s a first-class flyover that gives you a solid glimpse of what lies ahead. Hartl hits on a lot of different concepts: MVC architecture, RESTful routing, validations, associations, CSS, TDD, Rspec, Github and even deployment via Heroku. Now I can definitely understand why people do the Tutorial several times, because there is so much to pick up on.</p>

<p>However, for those of us that waited to do the tutorial until after class, it was mostly a solid review of things that Jeff taught us so well (seriously, he&rsquo;s the best). What made it all worth it though was the heavy exposure to Rspec and Test Driven Development (TDD). During the 12 weeks of Code Academy we just didn&rsquo;t have enough hours of class time to learn much testing, but Hartl pretty much doesn&rsquo;t do anything without writing a test for it in Rspec first. (Confession: for two days after the tutorial- which took us 6 full days- I was thinking about every action I took in &ldquo;describe&rdquo;-&ldquo;it&rdquo;- &ldquo;do&rdquo; statements. <em>Describe morning routine&hellip; it &ldquo;should brush my teeth&rdquo; do&hellip;</em>). And not only did we learn a lot about the syntax and structuring of tests, but we really got to see the value of TDD and how spending time writing tests can create a more solid piece of software and save that much more time in the long run.</p>

<p>This week I&rsquo;ll be helping some of my fellow alumni out with their projects, re-writing some of my own application and tackling some apprenticeship/internship projects&hellip;and you can sure as hell bet I&rsquo;ll be writing some tests.</p>

<p>Like many of my colleagues I&rsquo;m starting to learn Clojure and yesterday was a deep educational dive. I spent the day reading through several books and websites and working my through the Clojure Koans.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ginny&rsquo;s recommendation I particularly like the start of <a href="https://leanpub.com/fp-oo">Functional Programming for the Object Oriented Programmer</a> as a good overview of Clojure and how it works.</p>

<p>For websites I&rsquo;m spending a lot of of my time at <a href="http://clojuredocs.org">clojuredocs.org</a> and Cymen also recommended the excellent <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">clojure.org/cheatsheet</a>.</p>

<p>I also always have open a simple <a href="http://clojure.org/getting_started">REPL</a> so that as I learn (or try to learn) something I can play around with different variations.</p>

<p>On to day two.</p>

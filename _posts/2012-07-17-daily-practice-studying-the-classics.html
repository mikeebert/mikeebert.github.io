<p>At the end of the week <a href="http://www.twitter.com">@rsanmarchi</a> and I are taking our first extended vacation in a couple of years and making our first trip back to LA since we moved from there almost three years ago. The trip&rsquo;s been on the calendar for about a month now and Mike and I set some aggressive goals of things to try and finish on Phase 1 of the Sinatra app before I left.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been able to start picking up some steam and upped the velocity enough that it looks like I&rsquo;ll be pretty close to checking everything off the list. Although I&rsquo;m tempted to keep moving on the project while I&rsquo;m gone (because nothing goes together like <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/codeandcoffee">code &amp; coffee</a>, even on vacation) I think that hitting the end of the first phase is a good point to take a breather and catch up on a pair of apprenticeship patterns.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/perpetual_learning.html#practice_comma_practice_comma_practice">Daily Practice</a> there&rsquo;s a couple of katas I&rsquo;ve been meaning to work on and I&rsquo;ve also been eager to take another run at the <a href="http://skim.la/2010/07/28/clojure-koans-is-awesome/">Clojure koans</a>. It&rsquo;s been a couple of months since I&rsquo;ve really worked with Clojure and I think even a little bit of time with the koans will be a good refresher.</p>

<p>The two &ldquo;classics&rdquo; (from all the way back in 1999) that I&rsquo;m hoping to <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/construct_your_curriculum.html#study_the_classics">study</a> a little bit are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Technology/dp/0201485672">Refactoring</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342498676&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=pragmatic+programmer">The  Pragmatic Programmer</a>. I&rsquo;ve been flipping through Refactoring again over the past few weeks and every time I open it I find something new or something I re-read sinks in a little deeper. Both it and <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> are books I&rsquo;ve heard mentioned a lot since I first started programming, so I think it&rsquo;s safe to put both of them in the classics category.</p>

<p>It might be an ambitious vacation syllabus, but I definitely want to carry some of the momentum from the past couple of weeks.</p>

<p>The second episode of <a href="http://www.cleancoders.com/codecast/clean-code-episode-2/show">Clean Coders</a> covers some key rules to keep in mind when naming your variables, classes and methods. I&rsquo;ve read parts of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> book before so much of this was review, but it was a much-needed review. The video breaks down each rule into a section with a tidy, animated title sequence— but it was actually two comments made without fanfare that were the big takeaways for me.</p>

<h3>1) &ldquo;The true cost of software is in maintenance&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;ve read or heard this statement before, but maybe because I&rsquo;ve been working with the same tic-tac-toe code for two-and-a-half months now that it <em>really</em> sunk in this time. There have been many times that I&rsquo;ve wanted to scrap all of the code I&rsquo;ve written and start from scratch, but working with and cleaning up my original code has been a valuable lesson, and little by little I&rsquo;ve managed to get it to a relatively maintainable state. Leaving code <strong>cleaner than you found it</strong> is also a key component of the 8th Light philosophy so it&rsquo;s been good for me to practice that on my own code.</p>

<p>I can also now start to see an even clearer picture of why clean code that is test driven, adheres to SOLID principles and uses established design patterns will ultimately save a customer or company that much more money— both in the long run and in the short run.</p>

<p>A huge amount of time and effort can be lost if a developer needs to figure out and/or rewrite poorly written code every time they want to make an upgrade or add a feature. Developers should <em>hope</em> that the project their working on is successful enough to be passed on to others, so it&rsquo;s important that anyone should be able to jump in on a section of the codebase and not feel like they&rsquo;re completely lost.</p>

<p>Even when a solo developer is &ldquo;cranking&rdquo;, code they wrote just a few weeks ago could feel like a distant memory, but if they&rsquo;ve approached their code with a disciplined practice then it will be that much easier for them to go back and tweak something or add a feature.</p>

<h3>2) &ldquo;Names are not just for our convenience, they are the tools we use to communicate&rdquo;</h3>

<p>My second takeaway from the episode ties all of this savings in time and money back to the specifics of naming and how it leads to better code. As I discussed in some of my earlier posts and as one of the main points of both <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/19714111188">McBreen&rsquo;s</a> and <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/22269694339">Beck&rsquo;s</a> books- <strong>developing good software is about people</strong> more than anything else. It&rsquo;s about having a steady and clear line of communication between developers, customers and users—and it&rsquo;s much easier for those people to talk about code that has clearly named variables, classes and functions. The episode covers several specific guidelines for good naming techniques, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spoil it for you. I definitely recommend checking out the book or the video.</p>

<p>This week has easily felt like two and possible even three. All week I was confused as to what day it is. Monday felt like Tuesday, Wednesday felt like Monday and although it&rsquo;s 7 p.m. on a Friday and I&rsquo;m home with my feet up for some reason it still doesn&rsquo;t feel like the end of the week.</p>

<p>I had a lot going on this week and I wasn&rsquo;t able to switch contexts very well (clearly, since I couldn&rsquo;t even switch from day to day). For that reason I constantly felt like my head was out of the game and I was getting frustrated with my progress. As of last night, the user stories I&rsquo;d taken on for this week weren&rsquo;t completely done and I felt like two weeks after my <a href="http://mikeebert.tumblr.com/post/22826612267/deep-dive-into-limelight">dive into my Limelight</a> I was still wrestling an alligator in a pit of mud to make it do what I wanted instead of frolicking through a field of fresh flowers with a new-found friend.</p>

<p>However, the past couple of days when I&rsquo;ve found myself feeling &ldquo;out of it&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve taken a quick break (either a cup of coffee or a power nap on the 8th Light hammock), popped on the headphones, and spent a few minutes doing one of the three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">katas</a> I&rsquo;ve worked on. I&rsquo;ve probably done each of them 30 times at this point but each time I do it something else clicks for me.</p>

<p>Although it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a kata, during Code Academy I had a similar routine. Almost every afternoon when I wanted to work on something that we learned during class I&rsquo;d build a rails app from scratch to bring me up to the point that I could work on that day&rsquo;s lesson. It might have taken me 30 minutes to build out the routes, controllers, models and views I needed, but every time I did it I had a little better understanding of the MVC relationship or the nuances of rails.</p>

<p>The added effect of the methodic approach of a kata or building out a simple CRUD app is that it always helps my brain shift. Like a basketball player shooting free throws, a musician playing scales or a martial artist performing a … kata — the moments after I&rsquo;ve warmed up I definitely feel much more in the game.</p>

<p>&hellip;and sure enough, in the past 24 hours that alligator named Limelight that I&rsquo;d been wrestling has calmed down quite a bit. I think he&rsquo;s even going to let me just hook up all of my existing Ruby code to him and play nice. It means that this weekend I&rsquo;ll have to work on the stories that were due this week, but I&rsquo;ve actually really been looking forward to a nice long weekend to relax and write some code. Since we have a three day weekend I&rsquo;m sure that Monday will feel like Sunday and Tuesday will feel like Monday- but I think I&rsquo;ll be ok with that.</p>

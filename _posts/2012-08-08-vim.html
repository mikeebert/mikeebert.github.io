<p>The past couple of weeks I started using Vim as my primary editor. I was pretty comfortable using TextMate and the standard OS X keyboard shortcuts for most of my text editing tasks, but the decision to switch came down to one thing: real estate.</p>

<p>My main computer has been an 11&quot; laptop and I often find myself squeezing every last pixel out of it. By running Vim in fullscreen I gained precious space when using side by side windowsâ€” which I&rsquo;m usually doing when test driving my code. Vim is also the most widely used editor around the office, so once I start pairing more with other apprentices and craftsman I definitely want to be sure I&rsquo;m comfortable with it. Now that I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune of inheriting a hand-me-down 17&quot; laptop from the craftsmen I still find myself using Vim (with even more windows open)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m becoming pretty efficient with it and I may have even already passed my TextMate productivity point. However, when I&rsquo;m going to be primarily reading through code I still find myself opening that project in TextMate. I think I prefer it more because it&rsquo;s a matter of context switching. When I&rsquo;m in Vim I always have my hands on the keyboard, ready to type out the next command, but when I read through a project in TextMate my hands leave the keyboard and I grab the mouse to scroll through files and click through the familiar folder icons and directory structures. I wonder if those feelings will change as I spend more time in Vim&hellip;</p>

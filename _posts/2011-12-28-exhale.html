<p>The first big step is done. Last week my fellow Code Academ-ians and I gave our Demo Night presentations on where we came from, what we learned and where we want to go from here. Even though I&rsquo;d heard most people&rsquo;s presentations multiple times during practice it was an inspiring evening and I&rsquo;m proud to call them my classmates. There was a tangible energy in a room of over 200 people as each student discussed their experiences and laid out their hopes and expectations.</p>

<p>Seeing as how I&rsquo;ve framed much of my experiences at Code Academy through the <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/">Apprenticeship Patterns</a> book I thought it was only fitting that I did the same with my presentation. I talked about my cycling background, the <em>shift</em> to something new and the patterns of &ldquo;Expanding Your Bandwidth&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kindred Spirits&rdquo; and &ldquo;Breakable Toys&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Like many of my fellow classmates I&rsquo;d run through my presentation 15 or 20 times out loud (and hundreds of times in my head)- but nothing still really prepared me for those moments building up to when I went on. My heart started racing, my throat got a little tight&hellip; it reminded me exactly of the first time I ever spoke into a live mic during my midnight DJ stints at <a href="http://www.krcc.org">KRCC</a>. But it wasn&rsquo;t the presentation itself that made me nervous, it was really just saying my opening line out loud to a room that included some extremely talented developers: &ldquo;My name is Mike Ebert and I want to be a software craftsman&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Me? A sofware craftman? A guy that wrote his first lines of code less than three months ago? What do I know about software development? &hellip; um well, for starters I know that I need to learn a lot more. I also know that when I see experienced developers write a test, make it pass and refactor their code into something simple and clean I think it&rsquo;s borderline beautiful&ndash; and that I want to learn how to do it. I also know that the cycles of concentration, sometimes frustration and eventually elation that I&rsquo;ve experienced while writing code feel a lot like training for cycling did&ndash; and I definitely enjoyed that.</p>

<p>So the big question now for the alumni of Code Academy 1.0 is &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;. I think that despite our different long-term goals most of us are at the same place right now. We want to keep learning, keep building and carry the momentum that we&rsquo;ve built up over the last 12 weeks. In order to do that through the normally quiet holiday period I&rsquo;ve been hosting a &ldquo;Holidays with Hartl&rdquo; study group here at the apartment and Vince, Alfonso, Tom C, Rudy, Scott, Steve and myself have been working our way through the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a>. Some of it is review but we&rsquo;re picking up on a lot of little things and it&rsquo;s connecting more dots for us. The biggest lesson for me is definitely getting more exposure to <a href="http://rspec.info/">Rspec</a> and test driven development. It&rsquo;s starting to sink in a little bit more and I&rsquo;m anxious (and slighly overwhelmed) to go back and rebuild some of my apps using TDD. However, I know that if I start with the small ones it won&rsquo;t be so bad and I can definitely see how in the long run TDD is the only way to go if you want to build a really solid piece of software.</p>

<p>&hellip;and &ldquo;Holidays with Hartl&rdquo; is just a plan for the first week after Code Academy. 2012 starts on Sunday with a whole series of weeks to keep learning and keep growing. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

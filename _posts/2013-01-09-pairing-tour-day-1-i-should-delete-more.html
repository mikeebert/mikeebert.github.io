<p>Nothing kicks off a pairing tour like spending the day with the CEO. <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/paul-pagel">Paul</a> was first on my list and we spent the entire day writing and refactoring- but rather than working with code we were working with text. As the CEO Paul is constantly working-on and iterating-over ways to help the company, so I was able to work with him while he wrote some thoughts down and then see how he organized them. I used the word “refactoring” because Paul approaches his writing in what feels like a very TDD way.</p>

<p>He starts out by writing down sections and blocks of sentences of what he wants to say. This builds momentum and he doesn&rsquo;t have to spend time thinking about form. Then he shifts that block of writing towards the bottom of the page (or screen) and takes a shot at rewriting those thoughts into new sentences— or if he’s happy with how he said something the first time then he&rsquo;ll pull it to the top.</p>

<p>He rapidly moves through this process of rewriting and moving sentences around until he&rsquo;s satisfied- but there&rsquo;s one other step to his workflow that I need to be better at: he fearlessly deletes sentences and even entire sections. If he’s rewriting a sentence and doesn’t feel the words are clearly stating what he wants- he&rsquo;ll delete it before spending too much time on it. If he rewrites a new concise sentence that get his point across- he&rsquo;ll immediately delete all of his brainstorming text at the bottom of the page. If the delete was a mistake there&rsquo;s always the undo-key, but otherwise he knows that his next run at the thought will probably be better anyway.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely been feeling like I need to delete a lot more code. When starting out with JavaScript and Java on the last two projects I was so nervous that I&rsquo;d forget how I did something that I ended up leaving in code that in hindsight almost feels like a spike (I say almost because I did write tests first). Now when I go back and look at the code I wrote a couple of months ago I know that it would be trivial to rewrite most of the methods- especially if I already have a test in place.</p>

<p>The past few weeks the phrase that&rsquo;s been bouncing around my head is Uncle Bob&rsquo;s saying: &ldquo;the only way to go fast is to go well&rdquo;, but with the addendum &ldquo; &hellip;and fearlessly&rdquo;. We can all go faster by going well and being confident that each refactoring, each revision, or even a complete rewrite will most likely be better than our previous attempt.</p>

This is the home of my blog, originally hosted at [mikeebert.tumblr.com](https://mikeebert.tumblr.com). A huge shoutout to the folks who've contributed to [JekyllImport::Tumblr module](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/tumblr/) and made the process pretty simple. If you notice any dead or broken links please ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mikeebert).

To serve this blog locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from the
command line.

This is a pretty standard jekyll blog using the `github-pages` gem. I
made some initial overrides off the bat in the following files:
* `config.yml` (the basics, of course)
* `index.md`
* `posts.md`
* `_includes/footer.html`
* `_layouts/home.html`
* `assets/main.scss` (I like small type)

For 13 years I lived in the cycling world. I raced full-time (mainly in the US but with two stints in Europe), managed teams, organized [events](https://www.abdcycling.com), coached athletes and worked in [bike shops](http://www.prairiepathcycles.com).

Then I jumped into the world of software. As a consultant at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/) I helped companies delivery quality productsâ€” whether that meant writing code,
helping to build stronger teams, or developing a more seamless process.
I'm now currently building things at [Edovo](https://www.edovo.com) with an amazing group of
people.
